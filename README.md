# 🔥 Automatic Fire Alarm & Extinguisher System

This project is an automatic fire detection and extinguishing system built using Arduino UNO, IR flame sensor, L298N motor driver, DC water pump, and a buzzer.  
It detects fire using the IR sensor, raises an alarm, and activates a water pump to extinguish the fire automatically.
